# nyt-pretend
Mockup of an NYT article, just for fun / practise!  This is a homage to the original [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).  Actually it's mainly a homage to the layout.
I've changed the text for copyright reasons.
